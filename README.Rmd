## Overview

**bayesFPCA** is an R package providing tools for univariate and multivariate 
functional principal component analysis (FPCA) in the Bayesian setting. It 
provides efficient variational inference implementations (mean-field and 
variational message passing).

## Warning

**This is a development branch**, it is not guaranteed to be stable at
any given time and features are subject to change. Please use the
[stable version](https://github.com/hruffieux/bayesFPCA), unless you want
to test and report issues.

## Installation

Then, to install the package in R, run the following command:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hruffieux/bayesFPCA", ref = "devel")
```

## Main functions

The two main functions to perform univariate and multivariate FPCA inference are
`run_mfvb_fpca()` for the mean-field variational Bayes implementation and 
`run_vmp_fpca()` for the variational message passing implementation.

The package also provides a number of functions to generate and display 
functional data as well as the resulting FPCA estimates.
